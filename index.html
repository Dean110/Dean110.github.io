          <p>
            Bosco roamed the mean streets of Franklin County in search of
            adventure, love, and fulfillment. Once he had achieved all those
            things he was captured by a person just doing their job, the dog
            warden, and then adopted by the Williams-Schwieterman household.

            <p class="project__description">
              One of Bosco's finest efforts at date, this project is ongoing and
              faces many day to day challenges that Bosco strives to overcome.
              The neighbor's dog has been determined to be a threat to household
              security and Bosco continues to try to dig a covert tunnel into
              the neighbors yard to have a friendly conversation about chilling
              the heck out.

            <p class="project__description">
              Bosco's true passion for life is best seen while patrolling the
              mean streets of the Eastmoor North community. Bosco tirelessly
              marks all trees along his perimeter checks of the neighborhood
              boundaries. He also maintains checks on the Eruv of Columbus to
              help out his Jewish comrades during the week.

              Bosco strives to maintain the comfiest of all bedding
              possibilities with his collection of worn blankets. He fashions
              intricate tunnels to maximize warm air flow to drive out un-comfy
              vibes from his basement chill spot.
